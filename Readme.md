# Ji4ka EV Charging Point

This is a small project with the main objective to provide charging of EVs at the co-working space.
The power source from the electricity utility provides for up to 7KW single phase. Due to the limits set by the existing electrical installation, we chose AC charging with a maximum of 3,68Kw charging capabilities. 

### The existing installation is :

- Cabling with 3x2,5mm2 (L-N-PE) for the Electrical Schuko sockets
- Maximum length approx 4-5 meters
- Installed in pipes under the floor
- Residual current protection with nominal current 25A

Decision was made to extend one of the existing sockets, install surface mount cabling (Approx 2 meters) and install a protected Schuco socket outside of the office.This allows for convenient  connection with a AC Charging cable to the EV parked in front of the office ( When the parking place is available :) ).

For the outdoor Schuko sockets, we picked a IP55 socket which has a locking function with a key and it is rated 250V/16A. It is installed on the inner side of the roller shutter between the window frame and the roller shutter, which gives additional safety and also protection.

For a junction from the existing Schuko sockets Schneider Asfora hard cable module was used, which makes the junction look better. 

Due to the fact that there are other consumers connected at the same residual current protection, a smart power meter is not envisaged. All customers will charge their EVs using Ji4ka's Type 2 cable with built-in power meter available at the site. 

With the above setup, a customer with a need for EV charging can draw some AMPs directly at the site while working, which for a 8 hour charging gives about 28KWh, more than enough for city driving.

If you also need such a home/office EV charging point, let us know and will design and install one for you. Leave an email to info@irdroid.com with your particular requirements.
